# STATE.md — Yomineko Corpus Build (progress + resume)

> **Status legend:** `pending` · `in_progress` · `done` · `needs_review` · `blocked`
> Spec: [`YOMINEKO_CORPUS_BUILD_SPEC.md`](YOMINEKO_CORPUS_BUILD_SPEC.md). Rules: [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md).

## ▶ RESUME HERE
**Next action:** ⏸ **AWAITING OWNER APPROVAL (gate).** Phases P-pre, L, and R are complete. All Phase R
deliverables are written (PLAN_REVIEW, source_coverage, schema_v2, quality_rubric, course_outline draft,
sources). **Do not begin P0 until the owner approves.** After approval: start **P0** (finalize scaffold; venv;
write SQLite migrations from `design/schema_v2.md`; `ATTRIBUTION.md`). See PLAN_REVIEW Part 5 for the 6 owner
decisions to confirm (esp. licensing/ShareAlike, pitch accent, romaji policy).

## Gate
**P0 → P7 do NOT begin until the owner approves the Phase R output.** L and R gate the build.

_Populated in P1; provenance also recorded in `design/sources.md`. (R3 may pull samples earlier for coverage probing.)_

## Validation thresholds (working defaults; may be revised in R3)
- Dissected sentences: **≥3 per vocab**, **≥5 per grammar point**; rich per-topic bank (hundreds where sources allow).
- AI-generated sentences: capped as a % per topic (cap set in R3), always `needs_review`.
- Zero unresolved reading/lemma mismatches against KANJIDIC2 / JMdict.

## Session log
- _(P-pre)_ Created dedicated git repo, folder tree, `CLAUDE.md`, `STATE.md`, `.gitignore`, `INDEX.md` stub.
- _(L)_ Clean-room analysis via isolated subagent (raw material never entered main context). Found a library
  of 11 courses / 73 modules / 621 lessons (beginner→intermediate→advanced spine + 8 supplements). Output:
  3 de-identified abstraction files, verified clean (no names, no verbatim/reworded text). Key gaps to beat:
  no pitch accent, no JLPT scaffolding, katakana/adjectives/time-vocab mis-sequenced, hard difficulty cliff.
- _(R3)_ Probed real datasets: kanji 100% covered (245), vocab ~99% after normalization, Tatoeba PT only 1.8%
  (→ generate pt-BR Layer B, EN-pivot 93.5%), audio 2.5% (→ TTS), ≥3/vocab & ≥5/grammar thresholds realistic.
- _(R2)_ Workflow: 4 cited research notes + adversarial verify (8 agents). Curricula/SLA/BR-market = solid;
  BR-PT = minor issues → 4 factual overstatements corrected at source (vowel "1:1", length 2.5–3x, /u/ "spread",
  ち/じ dialect) + SLA phonetic-component softening. Verification traces added to the notes.
- _(R1/R4/R5/R6)_ Wrote PLAN_REVIEW (audit + 14 decisions + improved-spec addendum), schema_v2 (6 hard examples
  pass), quality_rubric (6 dims + hard gates + pilot gate), course_outline draft (pre-N5/N5/N4), sources.md.
  **STOPPED at the approval gate per the kickoff instruction.**
