## ▶ RESUME HERE

> **▶▶ NEXT WHEN TOKENS REFRESH — two PLANNED initiatives (designed, NOT executed):**
> 1. **Translation accuracy + naturalness + FINAL validation** → [`design/translation_qa.md`]. Minimize AI
>    translation errors everywhere (JP phrases, kanji/particle/conjugation explanations, JP→pt-BR) + a final
>    gate that catches over-literal renderings ("Quanto a mim, sou estudante" vs natural "Eu sou estudante")
>    and AI-like prose; daily-life register, no slang. **Start order in §7** (cheap wins first: extend
>    `detect_ai_tells` with anti-literalism patterns + full pt↔EN cross-check). Includes a **license audit —
>    owner ruling needed on the CC BY-SA backbone (JMdict/KANJIDIC/KanjiVG); enforce permissive-only (no SA,
>    no copyright) on all NEW material**.
> 2. **In-lesson reading-practice boxes** → [`design/reading_practice.md`]. Optional `<reading>` boxes,
>    pre-N5 none → N5 light → N4 more → N3 more (ramping mid-N3); hard-gated to each lesson's known-set;
>    **grounded in real CC-licensed text (Tatoeba CC BY/CC0 + JEC CC BY) with trusted EN**, generation last
>    resort. Can reuse the QA tooling from (1).
> Complementary permissive sources re-checked (no SA): Tatoeba (CC BY/CC0) + JEC stay primary; Aozora (PD) +
> Wikidata Lexemes (CC0) optional; KFTT/Wikipedia/Tanaka (CC BY-SA) now EXCLUDED by the no-SA rule.

> **2026-06-25 (b) — corpus fully BILINGUAL (pt-BR + en) + N2/N1 banks given pt-BR.** Owner: "N2/N1 should
> also have pt-BR; the rest also have English." Built a reusable distinct-string translation pipeline
> (`tr_extract.py` → `tr_workflow.js` → `tr_load.py`, + `tr_form_meanings.py`):
> - **N2/N1 pt-BR:** generated pt-BR `meanings`/`gloss` for 1,514 kanji + 7,955 vocab senses (EN→pt-BR).
> - **English for the rest (corpus layer):** generated `en` for every derived pt-BR field — grammar
>   (label/explanation/formation/nuance/form_meanings) + families + sentences (translation/literal/
>   structure_explanation) + tokens (gloss/role/conjugation_note) + particles (function/explanation).
>   Sentences missing the Tatoeba `en` got a pt→en translation too. Coverage: sentence-level 5,565/5,565,
>   tokens/particles 100% of non-empty. ~107k `en` localized_text rows.
> - Exporters (`export_corpus.py`) now emit both locales from `localized_text`; corpus JSON is
>   `{"pt-BR":…,"en":…}` throughout. **Course/topic/lesson stay pt-BR-only** as specified. Re-synced; build
>   clean; **no-leak holds** (client 441KB unchanged — en doubling is server-side only). Spec marked DONE in
>   `design/i18n.md` + `design/product_roadmap.md`.

> **2026-06-25 — N3 completed to parity + N2/N1 bank-only extension + English-preservation plan.**
> - **N3 Tranche 3:** authored 47 vocab-expansion lessons → N3 now **100% vocab (1,596), 100% kanji (364),
>   100% grammar (132) placed**, **101 lessons** (was 54), **607-sentence dissected bank** wired into lessons.
>   Re-authored 12 accent-stripped lessons; added durable **numeric-id ref resolution** (homographs) to
>   `load_lessons.py` + `audit_coverage.py`, with `export_course.py` dereffing id→headword for the display
>   layer. Course = **314 lessons**. validate_lessons 0 err · coverage 0 FAIL/0 WARN · hygiene 0 FAIL · no-leak OK.
> - **N2/N1 banks (kanji + vocab ONLY; no sentences/grammar/lessons/pedagogy)** — owner directive: minimum for
>   FSRS, modern/used only. `scripts/ingest/ingest_n2_n1.py` (additive, **Jōyō grade 1–8 gate** + 4-lineage
>   consensus; archaic vocab dropped) → **+1,514 kanji (380 N2, 1,134 N1), +4,446 vocab (1,768 N2, 2,678 N1)**.
>   Kanji total ≈ full Jōyō (2,131). Layer-A **English** meanings populated (pt-BR deferred). Exported as
>   **bank-only levels** (`export_corpus.py` `BANK_LEVELS`); prototype browse shows N2/N1 filters (verified).
>   Methodology: [`design/n2_n1_bank.md`]; sources in `research/datasets/jlpt/MANIFEST.md`.
> - **PLAN (not built):** preserve English alongside the original for the **corpus layer** (kanji/vocab/grammar/
>   sentences), NOT course/topic/lesson — Layer-A English already in the `en` key; Layer-B/C `en` parallel is a
>   future pass. Spec: [`design/i18n.md`] "Roadmap — preserve English"; backlog in `design/product_roadmap.md`.
> - **NEXT options (not started):** N3 vocab-anchored sentence bank toward N4 volume (~+4k); N2/N1 pt-BR glosses;
>   English Layer-B parallel pass.

> **2026-06-17 (round 5) — validator completeness: closed the two real gaps.** Asked "are all required validators
> there?" — they weren't. Fixed:
> - **No single gate** → `scripts/validate/validate_all.py` runs the whole suite (8 HARD validators + 2 advisory)
>   and exits non-zero if any hard check fails. **One command = the build gate.**
> - **Standing P8 hygiene rules had no committed guard** (emoji/backslash/em-dash/accent-stripping/empty-tags/
>   run-together/meta-leak/non-ASCII-identifiers were only one-off scans) → `scripts/validate/audit_lesson_hygiene.py`
>   now enforces them (key-aware: learner text only, not identifiers). 0 FAIL.
> - **Ran 4 validators I'd been ignoring:** `graph_queries` (§1.7 design tests — all 4 PASS), `completeness_audit`
>   (info markers only, no hard fail), `detect_ai_tells` (flagged 15 → fixed the 2 real "vale notar/lembrar"
>   fillers; the other 13 are false positives — they explain the "não só A, mas também B" grammar pattern),
>   `r3_coverage_probe` (one-off dataset probe, not a gate).
> **GATE GREEN:** validate_lessons · integrity_audit · audit_coverage · audit_manifest · audit_export_refs ·
> audit_lesson_hygiene · graph_queries · validate.py → all HARD PASS (run `validate_all.py`).
>
> **2026-06-17 (round 4) — ALPHA-READINESS audit: caught + fixed EXPORT-layer gaps the DB validators missed.**
> Pushed back on "all green" and audited the EXPORT (not just the DB). Found + fixed real Alpha-blockers:
> - **Phantom kanji refs:** 米/港/市 were taught + referenced in lesson bodies but, being level-NULL, were
>   dropped from `corpus/kanji/n4.json` → dangling refs in the export. Gave them an honest **low-confidence
>   level=n4 + level_sources** ("author-added; outside consensus lists", §1.5-compliant) so they export, with
>   pt meanings in `localized_text`.
> - **Leaf schema non-conformance:** `export_course.py` emitted lesson leaves with `slug` + plain-string
>   title/description/objectives, but the documented schema (courseware_architecture §2.4) + all other tiers use
>   `id` + locale-objects `{"pt-BR":…}`. Fixed the exporter (leaf + exercises now `id` + locale-objects).
> - **New validator `scripts/validate/audit_export_refs.py`** (closes the gap): checks every lesson leaf is
>   schema-conformant AND every unlock + inline body ref (`<kanji|vocab|grammar|sentence ref>`) resolves against
>   the EXPORTED corpus. Now **0 FAIL**.
> - **Doc drift fixed** (from the eval): kanji counts 100→80 (N5), 245→250 (N5+N4); grammar 363→364; families
>   58→396; manifest `enums_ref` path; **kana SRS-bootstrap-words marked DEFERRED/not-implemented** (0 vocab
>   unlocks in kana lessons — docs had overclaimed it).
> **Full 6-validator suite GREEN:** validate_lessons 213/213 · integrity_audit 0/0 · coverage 0/0 · manifest
> 0 FAIL · **audit_export_refs 0 FAIL** · validate.py 4958 0 errors.
>
> **2026-06-17 (round 3) — project-evaluation fixes (corpus content).** 7-agent eval (sentences/grammar/vocab/
> kanji + docs + schema). Fixed: gp-60 pattern `～ら`→`～たら`; stripped KANJIDIC radical-name leak from 6 kanji
> meanings (+ durable filter in `prepare_meanings.py`); 休 "dormir"→descanso/folga; deleted 1 unused broken AI
> sentence + fixed 1 pt. Caveats from before fully cleared (kanji placement via loader backfill; pl-08 痔 removed;
> 13 real cards added to no-card lessons).
>
> **2026-06-17 (round 2) — validation re-review fixes + a spacing regression caught & repaired.** Ran a fresh
> full validation (18 reviewers): dist 132×5 / 47×4 / 7×3 / 6×2. Fixed every flag: accent-stripped
> description/objectives/exercise fields across the corpus (`fix_accents_lessons.py`, 454+10 words, now
> KEY-AWARE so it never touches slug/topic/ref); meta-leaked descriptions (passiva-02, conectando-02, verbos-05/06,
> hiragana-06, adjetivos-05); editing scars / pt-in-`<jp>` / reading mismatches (potencial-01, oracoes-relativas-05,
> katakana-09, particulas-lugar-07, suposicao-04/05/07). **Caught my own regression:** the emoji stripper had
> trimmed single spaces at `<text>` boundaries, running ~10.6k words together — fixed the stripper and re-inserted
> the spaces (`fix_boundary_spaces.py`). **Caught a second self-inflicted bug pre-load:** the accent fixer had
> accented IDENTIFIERS (numeros→números, suposicao→suposição, experiencia→experiência, particulas→partículas,
> saudacoes→saudações) in slug/topic/exercise-slugs/body-refs of 37 files + spawned a duplicate accented filename;
> reverse-fixed all (`fix_identifier_accents.py`) and reconciled filenames. Added 8 more real cards via
> `enrich_examples_surface.py` (surface-match fallback, flagged lower-confidence).
> **Final state ALL GREEN:** validate_lessons 213/213 0/0 · integrity_audit 0/0 · coverage 0 FAIL/1 cosmetic WARN ·
> manifest 0 FAIL · validate.py 0 errors · scans: 0 emoji / 0 backslash / 0 accent-stripped / 0 run-together /
> 0 bad-identifier. New scripts: fix_boundary_spaces, fix_identifier_accents, fix_accents_lessons,
> enrich_examples_surface. **Lesson learned (recorded in quality_rubric §P8): mechanical text fixers must be
> key-aware — never rewrite identifier fields (slug/topic/ref) or trim word-separating spaces at tag boundaries.**
>
> **2026-06-17 — P8 QUALITY PASS COMPLETE (pushed) + standing rules recorded.** Full per-lesson quality review
> (18 reviewers over 213 lessons) + corpus audits → fixed everything found and encoded the rules in
> [`design/quality_rubric.md`](design/quality_rubric.md) §P8 + [`research/local-course-insights/course_volume_comparison.md`](research/local-course-insights/course_volume_comparison.md).
> - **Fixed:** 3,072 over-escaped `\"` artifacts across 65 lessons (`fix_escape_artifacts.py`); 7 accent-stripped
>   lessons restored; 3 lessons where a polish agent returned meta-text as body (restored from git + re-polished);
>   ~10 editing-scar / corrupted-heading / wrong-gloss / garbled-token / confusing-example fixes; 6 meta-leaked
>   `description` fields rewritten. **Emoji removed from ALL learner text** (347 fields; `strip_emoji_lessons.py`) —
>   cues now come from `<note type>` blocks only (owner directive).
> - **Bank usage:** diagnosed (linkage-bound: only ~2,007 of 4,959 sentences are grammar-linked; ~2,952 unlinked).
>   `enrich_examples.py` added 63 REAL (Tatoeba-first) example cards to 51 grammar lessons → 511 featured (~2.4/lesson,
>   ~68% real). Standing rule: prefer real over AI in examples/exercises.
> - **Kanji coverage VERIFIED correct + balanced:** all 80 N5 kanji in the N5 course, all 170 N4 kanji in N4, 0
>   level/module mismatches, max 6/lesson. **Exercises** ~5/lesson (1,053 total) — good, not heavy.
> - **All green:** validate_lessons 213/213 0/0 · integrity_audit 0/0 · audit_coverage 0 FAIL/1 cosmetic WARN ·
>   audit_manifest 0 FAIL · validate.py 4959 0 errors · 0 emoji · 0 backslash · 0 meta-leak · 0 accent-stripped.
> - New durable scripts: `fix_escape_artifacts.py`, `strip_emoji_lessons.py`, `enrich_examples.py`,
>   `audit_coverage.py`, `audit_manifest.py`. **A fresh validation workflow was launched after these changes.**
>
> **▶ NEXT (P8 enrichment backlog, optional): ** (a) tagger pass to link more bank sentences to N4 grammar +
> surface vocab-example sentences (raise bank usage past linkage limit); (b) deep-dive depth on ~12 flagship
> topics; (c) durably place kanji 米/港/市; (d) audio (product roadmap, TTS over the bank). See quality_rubric §P8.
>
> **2026-06-16 — 🎉 FULL COURSE AUTHORED: pré-N5 → N5 → N4 COMPLETE (213 lessons, 35 topics).**
> pré-N5 41 · N5 81 · N4 91. All content topics (07–18 N5, 20–34 N4) + te-form + both revisão topics done.
> N4 authored in 5 batches via `author-n5-batch` (LEVEL='n4'); te-form via `author-teform-rest`; revisão
> (n5-19 + n4-35, 3 lessons each, 0 item unlocks) via `author-revisao` — the final lesson of each level unlocks
> `feat:jlpt-sim-n5` / `feat:jlpt-sim-n4`. **All green: validate_lessons 213/213 0/0 · integrity_audit 0 FAIL/0
> WARN · validate.py 4959 sentences 0 errors.** The self-healing pipeline (normalize_lesson_refs → dedupe_unlocks
> → repair_lesson_bodies → clean_emdash_lessons) made batch authoring near-hands-free: the repairer alone
> auto-fixed 100+ tag issues across N4 (stray closes, inline-nesting, bare text in heading/check, self-closing
> inline in text). One transient author failure (or-05) re-authored standalone.
>
> **2026-06-16 (cont.) — P7 STRUCTURAL AUDIT DONE (green).** Built two read-only P7 auditors:
> `scripts/validate/audit_coverage.py` (placed-vs-unlocked per kind + introduce-once over the whole graph) and
> `scripts/validate/audit_manifest.py` (4-tier manifest cross-links + counts + leaf body/cumulative + sentence_ref
> resolution). Fixed 8 coverage gaps (`patch_coverage_gaps.py`): now **vocab/kanji/grammar 0 gap, 0 dup**.
> audit_manifest **0 FAIL** (35 topics / 213 lessons, all paths + counts consistent). Remaining: 1 cosmetic WARN
> — kanji 市/港/米 are taught by lessons but have `introducing_topic_id` NULL (P4 never placed them; lesson_unlocks
> is the source of truth, so they ARE covered). FULL validator suite green: validate_lessons 213/213 0/0 ·
> integrity_audit 0/0 · audit_coverage 0 FAIL · audit_manifest 0 FAIL · validate.py 4959 sentences 0 errors.
>
> **▶ NEXT (optional polish): ** (a) durably place kanji 市/港/米 in P4 placement data to clear the last WARN;
> (b) humanizer/prose spot-check pass over a sample of lessons; (c) L-phase concept-level coverage comparison
> (confirm ours ⊇ the local course, naming nothing); (d) bootstrap-words pass (re-place a few N5 vocab into
> pré-N5 kana lessons for early SRS). **NOTE: pushes still pending — all work since e914575 is committed locally
> only; awaiting an explicit "push".**
>
> _Earlier 2026-06-16 progress (chronological):_
>
> **N5 topics 09–14 AUTHORED (42 lessons) + pipeline made self-healing.** Built a multi-topic
> `author-n5-batch` workflow (one planner→authors per topic, several topics per run) and authored, validated +
> committed: **numeros-tempo (9), verbos (6), particulas-lugar (8), passado (5), adjetivos (8), comparacoes (6)**.
> **N5 = 53 lessons (topics 07–14 + te-form pilot); corpus = 95 lessons total.** validate_lessons 95/95 0/0 ·
> integrity_audit 0 FAIL/0 WARN · validate.py 4959 sentences 0 errors.
> - **New durable post-author pipeline steps** (run in this order after `write_authored_lessons.py`, before
>   `load_lessons.py`): `normalize_lesson_refs.py` (rewrites `vocab:<kana>` → canonical `vocab:<headword>` via
>   exact-kana→unique-headword; reports ambiguous/unresolved) · `dedupe_unlocks.py` (introduce-once: drops a
>   duplicate unlock from the LATER lesson — safe because cumulative_known_set is cumulative; also collapses
>   intra-lesson dups) · `repair_lesson_bodies.py` (conservative stack-based tag repair: fixes the recurring
>   typo `</jp>`-for-`</text>`, drops truly-stray closes, closes missing end tags — ONE such typo used to
>   cascade into dozens of "<text> may not contain <text>" errors) · `clean_emdash_lessons.py` (strips banned
>   em dash U+2014 from ALL string fields, not just body; chōon ー U+30FC untouched).
> - **Batch-workflow caveats encoded:** author agents (a) sometimes WRITE files directly to
>   `research/derived/lessons/` (they have Write + infer the path) → prompt now says "do NOT write any file;
>   return structured output only", and I clear a topic's files before writing its canonical `.output`; (b)
>   occasionally return `body:"placeholder"` → prompt now forbids stubs; (c) still occasionally typo tags →
>   `repair_lesson_bodies.py` fixes mechanically; structural re-author is the fallback.
> - **Full per-batch recipe:** edit `author-n5-batch` `TAILS` → run via scriptPath → `write_authored_lessons`
>   → `normalize_lesson_refs` → `dedupe_unlocks` → `repair_lesson_bodies` → `clean_emdash_lessons` →
>   `load_lessons` → `validate_lessons` (re-author any lesson with residual tag-nesting/placeholder) →
>   `export_course` → commit.
>
> **2026-06-16 (cont.) — N5 topics 16–18 AUTHORED (17 lessons): convites (6), rotina (?), conectando (?).**
> Processed via the full recipe; repairer enhanced to also split balanced inline-nesting
> (`<text>A<emphasis>B</emphasis>C</text>` → siblings) + drop empty `<text></text>`. **N5 content topics 07–18
> COMPLETE; corpus = 112 lessons.** validate_lessons 112/112 0/0 · integrity_audit 0/0.
>
> **2026-06-16 (cont.) — topic-15 te-form COMPLETE (pilot 01 + lessons 02–08 = 8).** `author-teform-rest`
> workflow excluded the pilot's items (gram:te-form/te-kudasai, vocab:乗る) and authored 02–08 (て-chaining,
> ています/てある, orações relativas, permissão/proibição, obrigação + contractions). repairer further enhanced
> to split self-closing inline (`<vocab/>`/`<grammar/>`/`<kanji/>`) out of `<text>`. **N5 content COMPLETE
> (topics 07–18 + te-form); corpus = 119 lessons.** All N4 content topics (20–34) PREPPED. validate 119/119 0/0.
>
> **2026-06-16 (cont.) — N4 topics 20–25 AUTHORED (38 lessons):** forma-simples (7), oracoes-relativas (7),
> condicionais (8), potencial (4), volitivo (7), transitividade (5). Corpus = 157 lessons. validate 157/157 0/0 ·
> integrity_audit 0/0. **repair_lesson_bodies.py further enhanced** to (a) split self-closing inline `<vocab/>`
> out of `<text>` and (b) WRAP bare text in `<text>` when it sits in a non-inline context (`<heading>X</heading>`,
> `<check>X</check>`) — the agents frequently forget the wrapper at N4 scale; the repairer now auto-fixes it, so
> almost no manual re-authoring is needed. One transient author failure (socket close) left an empty stub file on
> disk → deleted + re-authored standalone (`author-or-05`); recipe note: a failed author may still leave a stub
> file, so delete + re-author rather than trust on-disk files for failures.

>
> **2026-06-16 — P6b FOUNDATION built + plans standardized (consistency-reviewed). Authoring unblocked.**
> Ran a 3-agent adversarial consistency review of the plans+code; it confirmed the design but found the
> needs/unlocks/srs model was documented-but-unimplemented + several doc inconsistencies. **Fixed all, then made
> the structure REAL end-to-end:**
> - **Standardization (docs):** `need_type` = unlock_type − {srs-deck} + lesson (enum+prose agree); **dropped
>   `srs-card`** (cards are always DERIVED from item unlocks); reconciled the two ref-namespace surfaces
>   (body chips vs needs/unlocks metadata); **topic numbering = GLOBAL** is canonical (course_outline TNN are
>   within-module labels w/ mapping); chunk caps are **per-lesson**; kana **11 base families** (WA + N separate,
>   matches registry) + explicit family→lesson grouping table; softened the feature "1:1" claim.
> - **Implemented (code):** migration `006_courseware.sql` (`lesson_unlocks`, `lesson_needs`); `enums.py`
>   (loads `unlock_enums.json`, the single source of truth) imported by loader+validator+exporter; enriched
>   `unlock_enums.json` (deck_registry + card-types + conjugation_form). `load_lessons.py` persists
>   needs/unlocks/feature_unlocks/description (back-compat w/ old `introduces`). `validate_lessons.py` enforces
>   enum membership + ref resolution + **needs-linearity** (every need unlocked by a strictly-earlier lesson) +
>   introduce-once over unlocks. `export_course.py` emits the **4-tier manifest** (manifest.json → course.json →

>
> **N5 PATTERN ESTABLISHED + topic-07 DONE (2026-06-16):** built the N5 plan→author pipeline —

> `author-n5-topic` workflow (1 planner splits the topic into lessons; author agents fan out, one per lesson,

> **topic-08 (perguntas) DONE = 6 lessons** (ここ/そこ/あそこ/どこ · この/その/あの · どれ/どの · 誰/どうして ·
> どんな/どうやって · なにか/か〜か). N5 = 11 lessons (+ te-form pilot = 12). validate_lessons 53/53 0/0 ·
> integrity_audit 0/0. **Hard-won workflow caveats (encoded):** (a) the Workflow `args` global does NOT reach
> this runtime — set TOPIC by HAND in the author-n5-topic script per topic (don't pass args). (b) author-n5-topic
> RULES now carry an explicit WRONG/RIGHT no-nested-`<text>` example (agents occasionally violate it → re-author
> the offenders). (c) `load_lessons.py` now PRUNES DB lessons whose authoring file was removed (files are
> authoritative) — fixed a stale-lesson introduce-once bug. (d) `prep_topic_authoring.py` + author-n5-topic now
> handle KANJI (planner assigns ≤6/lesson; lessons unlock kanji:CHAR). All N5 content topics already prepped to

> **2026-06-16 — COURSEWARE ARCHITECTURE planned (owner directives). Plans updated; ready for P6b build.**
> Designed the courseware data model + unlock/SRS/kana plans before bulk lesson authoring:
> - **`design/courseware_architecture.md`** (master "explains everything"): layered manifest **entry
>   (`manifest.json`) → course (`<level>/course.json`) → topic (`topic.json` w/ lesson stubs) → lesson
>   (`lesson-NN.json` full)**; the app builds the tree + unlock DAG from the light "required layer", lazy-loads
>   bodies. Per-lesson **`needs`/`unlocks`** + **FSRS deck/card** model + **lesson length** targets (300–700 words
>   reading + 4–8 examples + 4–8 exercises, 8–15 min; split if bigger).
> - **`design/unlock_enums.json`** — closed global taxonomy: `unlock_type`/`need_type` (kana-family, vocab, kanji,
>   grammar, conjugation-form, phrase, kanji-family, feature, srs-deck), `feature` (srs-reviews, conjugation-drill,
>   particle-drill, handwriting, jlpt-sim, visual-novel…), `card_type`, `deck`, `ref_namespace`. Validator/loader
>   import it.
> - **`design/kana.md`** — Hiragana/Katakana = topics; **one gojūon FAMILY per lesson** ("Família do A/KA/SA…"
>   + vozeamento GA/ZA/DA/BA/PA + yōon + っ/long); needs a NEW **kana registry** (`build_kana.py` →
>   `corpus/kana/*.json`); **SRS-bootstrap words** (kana-only, no grammar) are the SOLE linearity exception.
> - **FSRS:** decks by skill type; completing a lesson enrolls its items' cards (deck created on first card).
>   Build the registries/`srs.introduces_cards` now so authoring fills them.
> - Updated: `lesson_schema.md` (record metadata), `course_outline.md` (kana families + linearity), `product_roadmap.md` (§A rows + §H).
> - **Deep research RECOVERED (2026-06-16):** the workflow was killed mid-Fetch (1 stuck WebFetch), but 33/34
>   agents had completed — recovered **116 claims from 35 sources** from the journal
>   (`research/derived/deep_research_recovered.json`) and synthesized `research/deep-research-courseware.md`.
>   **Verdict: the research OVERWHELMINGLY CONFIRMS the plan** (4-tier manifest, closed needs/unlocks enum,
>   DAG-over-linear, per-skill FSRS decks w/ unlock-on-completion, family-per-lesson kana, worked-example ladder
>   each independently sourced). Applied 6 evidence-backed refinements: lesson-length reframed as a heuristic
>   (microlearning has NO consensus; ours runs longer for worked-example pedagogy); FSRS defaults (retention 0.90,
>   band 0.80–0.95, per-deck-preset) + block-then-interleave; worked→faded→free + expertise-reversal; stroke-order
>   static-over-animation caution; LRMI/Common-Cartridge provenance for needs/unlocks. (Verify phase didn't run →
>   confidences are conservative source-quality estimates; 1 source lost.)
>
> **▶ NEXT = P6b build, in order:** (1) `unlock_enums.json` loader/validator + widen `lesson_introduces`→`unlocks`
> + `lesson_needs` + `feature`/`deck`/`card` registries (DB migration); **(2) ✅ DONE — `build_kana.py` →
> kana registry: 211 kana / 57 families (28 hiragana + 29 katakana) in `corpus/kana/` + DB (`kana`,
> `kana_family`); `kana-family` refs = `kana:<script>-<row>`;** (3) author pré-N5 kana family lessons
> (+bootstrap words) → load → validate → export → commit per topic; (4) topic-by-topic (N5→N4) authoring;
> (5) `export_course.py` emits the 4 manifest tiers; (6) P7 audit (coverage, unlock-graph linearity, manifest
> cross-links). Reference lesson: `les-n5-te-form-01`.

> **2026-06-15 — P6a DONE: grammar placement re-sequenced (dependency-correct, no dumps). Authoring unblocked.**
> The P4 grammar placement was broken (keyword heuristic dumped 64 points into topic 7 via loose substrings —
> "da" in "kudasai" etc., violating dependencies). Replaced with a durable, AI-classified + adversarially
> verified map:
> - **Workflows:** classify 364 grammar → themed topics (13 batch agents + 2 per-level verifiers), then a

>   (`build_grammar_placement.py`: full coverage, same-level, て-form gate ≥topic 15, balance) into
>   **`design/grammar_placement.json`** (reviewable source of truth, 364 entries).
> - **`place_items.py` now consumes the map** (exact key match) instead of the keyword heuristic; the broken
>   `GRAMMAR_MAP` constant is removed. Re-placement: **max grammar/topic 64 → 27**; all 16 て-form
>   constructions cluster in topic 15; dependency scan clean (the 1 flag = false positive たくさん).
>   vocab/kanji placement was already sound (frequency-based) and is unchanged.
> - **Pilot** trimmed to a clean topic-15 lesson-1 (te-form + てください + 乗る; 出る/来る are pre-taught
>   examples, not introduced; てから deferred to its topic-17 placement). Em dashes removed; **validate_lessons
>   hardened to ban "—"**. validate_lessons = 0 errors/0 warnings; integrity_audit 0 FAIL/0 WARN; §10 held.
> - New scripts: `prep_grammar_placement_data.py`, `build_grammar_placement.py`. Provenance in
>   `research/derived/grammar_{to_place,assign_v1,rebalance_keys}.json` + `topics_ref.json`.
>
> **▶ NEXT = P6b (lesson authoring, per topic) → P7.** Placement is now correct, so author lessons: for each

> **2026-06-15 — P6 STARTED: rich-lesson FOUNDATION frozen + validated (atomic unit complete).**
> The lesson layer now has a durable, scalable, validated pipeline mirroring the corpus one
> (authored JSON → load → DB → export):
> - **Frozen schema** [`design/lesson_schema.md`](design/lesson_schema.md) v1 — machine-validatable freeze of
>   `lesson_format.md`: tagged HTML-like body (NO bare text; every piece wrapped), element/attr whitelist,
>   `ref=` namespaces (sent:/kanji:/vocab:/gram:/ex: + deferred img:/aud:/vid:), required structure (ends with
>   `<checklist>`; ≥1 retrieval + ≥1 production exercise), exercise answer-key shapes.
> - **Validator** `scripts/validate/validate_lessons.py` — enforces the above + ref resolution + introduce-once
>   + answer shapes. (Placement consistency = WARNING, see P6a.)
> - **Loader** `scripts/ingest/load_lessons.py` — generic/idempotent: `research/derived/lessons/*.json`
>   (durable authoring source, like dissection `*_result.json`) → DB (delete-then-insert by slug), computes
>   `cumulative_known_set`. Wired into `replay_all` (reset_sentences wipes lessons → reload on rebuild).
> - **Exporter** `export_course.py` now FLATTENS the tagged body → readable Markdown for the teacher-review
>   `.md` (refs resolved); `.json` keeps the app-ready tagged body.
> - **Pilot re-authored in rich format** (`author_pilot_lesson.py` → `research/derived/lessons/
>   les-n5-te-form-01.json`): the reference lesson bulk authoring mimics. **validate_lessons = 0 errors.**

>
> **▶ NEXT = P6a (placement re-sequencing) → P6b (lesson authoring) → P7.**
> - **P6a — fix the P4 grammar placement (BLOCKS authoring).** The first-pass placement has catch-all DUMPS
>   and dependency violations: topic 7 (desu-wa) holds **64** grammar incl. て-form-dependent points
>   (てください/てから) placed BEFORE て-form (topic 15) — violates curriculum.md §2 "no て-clauses before
>   て-form". Also topic 11 (31), topic 24 (30), topics 22/30 heavy. Re-distribute the 364 grammar (and
>   re-check vocab/kanji) across the 35 topics by **dependency + theme**, so each topic splits into
>   ~3–5-grammar lessons (chunk sizes curriculum.md §3). Lessons' `lesson_introduces` must ⊆ their topic's
>   placement (the validator warns when not). Likely a workflow (linguistic reasoning) + re-export outline.
> - **P6b — author lessons per topic** (one topic = atomic unit; workflow fan-out): split each topic's placed
>   items into lessons, author rich bodies referencing dissected sentences (i+1 within cumulative_known_set),
>   typed exercises, ending `<checklist>`. load_lessons → validate_lessons → export_course → commit per topic.
>   Add a per-kanji literacy strand (p6_authoring_spec §5) + conjugation/particle/JLPT exercise banks
>   (product_roadmap §C/§G). Use `les-n5-te-form-01.json` as the format reference.

> bugs the rebuild surfaced:
> - **Content blocklist** (`research/derived/content_blocklist.json` + gate in `persist()`, the single

>   AI "white underwear" `sent:gen-6189075543d7`; mild "kiss me" `sent:tatoeba-1284178`). Can never re-enter.
> - **Reproducibility bug #1**: `persist_batch.main()` kept ungrammatical AI (verdict.faithful=False) that the
>   replay path (`persist_pair`) correctly drops → 26 unfaithful AI had leaked into the bank. Fixed: `main()`
>   now delegates to `persist_pair` (one source of truth). Those 26 are now dropped (§10 held: only ±1 counts).
> - **Reproducibility bug #2**: `replay_all` didn't re-run `clean_emdash`, so a rebuild reintroduced 592 em
>   dashes (the cleaner edits the DB, not the saved `*_result.json`). Fixed: `clean_emdash --apply` is now a
>   replay post-step. **`replay_all` is now a FAITHFUL rebuild.**
> - Doc fixes: conjugation 408→508 (was stale in 2 docs); ATTRIBUTION enumerates all 6 JLPT lists;
>   corpus/INDEX.md gains the conjugations row; integrity_audit % now rounds (44.6→45).

> 2. **Start P6 lessons now** — every topic already has seed examples; author rich-format lessons

> 3. Hybrid: ensure **≥1 sentence for every taught item** first (cheaper than ≥3), then P6.
>
> **✅ Done earlier:** foundation+content (meanings 100%, grammar 364/364, families, pitch 89.8%); P7 groundwork
> (§1.7 graph queries PASS, review queue, L+ superset, objectives/overviews); **PRE-P5 i18n** (localized_text

**Plan (revised after 2026-06-14 gaps audit — see `reports/gaps_audit.md`):** content layers were
missing from the plan. Execute the ADDED steps in dependency order, THEN resume topic dissection:
1. **P5b — Layer-B pt-BR meanings (FOUNDATIONAL, do first):** translate `vocab_sense.gloss_en→gloss_pt`
   (4,061) + `kanji.meanings_en→meanings_pt` (250) via batch→Workflow→validate; populate
   `kanji_reading.example_vocab_ids`. Everything (lessons, glosses) depends on this.
2. **P6-grammar — Layer-C grammar explanations:** author `label_pt`+`explanation_pt`+`formation_pt`+
   `nuance_pt` per taught grammar point (Workflow, needs_review). ← owner flag.
3. **P4b — full families:** semantic_field / word_family / particle_set / contrast_pair so every item ∈ ≥1 family.
4. **P2b — pitch accent data:** source kanjium/OJAD-derived → `vocab_pitch` (data only; audio deferred).
5. **Then resume** mass dissection + lesson authoring topic-by-topic (recipe below), then **P7** QA.

### P5 status (engine v2 — batched + precise grammar linking): rebuilding bank from saved results.
**Engine v2 (current; run ONE workflow at a time):**
1. `prepare_batch.py --topic <slug> --targets <term:count …> --out research/derived/batch_<t>.json` — selects
   real Tatoeba within the i+1 known-set AND attaches the topic's `grammar_candidates` (key/pattern/label) to
   each item. (FTS5 is **trigram** → it can't match <3-char terms; prepare auto-falls back to LIKE for short
   targets like たい/一番/たり.)
2. (multi-topic) concat batches → `batch_all.json` (dedup by slug).
3. `split_groups.py <batch.json> <out_dir> 5` — K=5 sentences per GROUP file (slug-keyed, ~5× cheaper than
   1/agent, dodges the array-index bug).
4. Workflow **`scripts/ingest/dissect_batch_workflow.js`** (`yomineko-dissect-grp`), args
   `{dir, count=<#groups>}` → returns flat `[{layerB,verdict}]`. Each agent authors translation + literal +
   structure + per-token gloss/role/conjugation + particle function/explanation, AND returns
   **`grammar_keys`** = the candidate keys the sentence GENUINELY uses (strict, by meaning not substring →
   no 冷たい≠〜たい false-positives; picks affirmative/negative variant; multi-key OK).
5. Result envelope is `{summary,…,result:[…]}` — locate the `result` list (it has `layerB`), write bare array
   to `..._result.json`. `persist_batch.py --batch … --result …` (links grammar via agent keys; vocab/kanji
   from Layer-A tokenization).
6. `repair_glosses.py` (auto-fills any content token the agent skipped: from its vocab pt-gloss, else a
   closed-class dict; reports unresolved). Then `validate.py` (must be 0 errors), `export_corpus.py`, commit.
**Rebuild-from-results property:** the durable AI output is the saved `*_result.json` files. After any
persist/linking-logic change, `reset_sentences.py` + re-`persist_batch` from saved results rebuilds the bank
deterministically with NO new agent calls (only re-run the workflow if the agent's *output schema* changed).
**Still TODO in P5:** (a) raise per-topic counts to acceptance (≥3 sent/vocab, ≥5/grammar) — current batches
are seed-sized; (b) **sentence GENERATION path** for cold-start early topics (greetings/desu-wa/numbers: tiny
known-set → few Tatoeba hits) — generate i+1 JP flagged `ai_generated` then dissect same way; (c) P6
rich-lesson schema (`design/lesson_format.md`) finalized from real authored content.
Then **P7**: full validation, `reports/stats.md`, coverage comparison vs L+ `concept_inventory.md` (superset),
§1.7 cross-cutting query tests, assemble needs_review queue.
**Pipeline scripts:** dissect / select_candidates / prepare_batch / persist_dissection / persist_batch /
validate / add_pilot_lesson / export_corpus / export_course. Kana caveat は→わ,へ→え,を→o; pt-BR generated
Layer-B (EN-pivot); generous AI backfill all flagged; store kana+romaji; pitch data only (audio deferred).
**Scale reminder:** this is the multi-session bulk (~all topics × dissection + lessons).
Recommend pilot = **`top:n5-te-form`** (mid-N5; rich Tatoeba supply; known-set = items introduced in topics
order≤15). Steps: (1) **build the §7 validation suite first** (`scripts/validate/`); (2) write the SudachiPy
A+C **dissection pipeline** (kana caveat: は→わ, へ→え, を→お) emitting the §6 shape uniformly; (3) **select**
Tatoeba sentences via `raw_tatoeba_fts` whose tokens are within the topic's cumulative-known-set (i+1),
preferring those with EN/audio; (4) **Layer-B pt-BR**: generate translation + pt_literal + per-token gloss +
particle explanation, validate readings/lemmas vs KANJIDIC2/JMdict; persist to `sentence`/`token`/`particle`;
(5) author the topic's **lessons** (dense pt-BR + structured exercises, sentence refs BY ID); (6) export
`corpus/sentences/` + `course/n5/top-...`; **score vs `design/quality_rubric.md`** (all dims ≥3, gates pass);
fix; commit. Cumulative-known-set helper: items with `introducing_topic_id` whose topic.ord ≤ pilot topic.ord.
**DONE:** P-pre,L(+L+),R(approved),P0,P1,P2,P3,P4(1st-pass placement). Corpus (kanji 250 / vocab 1,359 /
grammar 364 / families 396) + course outline (35 topics) all exported to `corpus/`+`course/` as canonical
LLM-readable JSON+MD; SQLite is a regenerable index.
**Reminder:** real Tatoeba PT is 1.8% → generate pt-BR (Layer B, EN-pivot 93.5%); generous AI backfill (all
flagged); store kana+romaji; pitch data only (audio deferred). `sudachidict-full` installed.
**P5 dissection notes (verified):** `sudachidict-full` installed + SudachiPy A+C tokenization works. CAVEAT —
Sudachi `reading_form()` returns the *dictionary* reading, so override contextual particle kana in the
dissection: は→わ, へ→え, を→お (topic/direction/object particles). Build the §7 validation suite first; the
single dissection function must emit the §6 shape uniformly.

## Validation thresholds (working defaults; may be revised in R3)
- Dissected sentences: **≥3 per vocab**, **≥5 per grammar point**; rich per-topic bank (hundreds where sources allow).
- AI-generated sentences: capped as a % per topic (cap set in R3), always `needs_review`.
- Zero unresolved reading/lemma mismatches against KANJIDIC2 / JMdict.

## Session log
- _(P-pre)_ Created dedicated git repo, folder tree, `CLAUDE.md`, `STATE.md`, `.gitignore`, `INDEX.md` stub.
- _(L)_ Clean-room analysis via isolated subagent (raw material never entered main context). Found a library
  of 11 courses / 73 modules / 621 lessons (beginner→intermediate→advanced spine + 8 supplements). Output:
  3 de-identified abstraction files, verified clean (no names, no verbatim/reworded text). Key gaps to beat:
  no pitch accent, no JLPT scaffolding, katakana/adjectives/time-vocab mis-sequenced, hard difficulty cliff.
- _(R3)_ Probed real datasets: kanji 100% covered (245), vocab ~99% after normalization, Tatoeba PT only 1.8%
  (→ generate pt-BR Layer B, EN-pivot 93.5%), audio 2.5% (→ TTS), ≥3/vocab & ≥5/grammar thresholds realistic.
- _(R2)_ Workflow: 4 cited research notes + adversarial verify (8 agents). Curricula/SLA/BR-market = solid;
  BR-PT = minor issues → 4 factual overstatements corrected at source (vowel "1:1", length 2.5–3x, /u/ "spread",
  ち/じ dialect) + SLA phonetic-component softening. Verification traces added to the notes.
- _(R1/R4/R5/R6)_ Wrote PLAN_REVIEW (audit + 14 decisions + improved-spec addendum), schema_v2 (6 hard examples
  pass), quality_rubric (6 dims + hard gates + pilot gate), course_outline draft (pre-N5/N5/N4), sources.md.
  **STOPPED at the approval gate per the kickoff instruction.**
