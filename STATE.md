## ▶ RESUME HERE
**Next action:** **P4 — finalize the course outline with item placement**, then the **P5 pilot**. Concretely:
1. **P4:** turn `design/course_outline.md` (draft) into the final placement — assign each of the 250 leveled
   kanji + 1,359 leveled vocab + (enumerated) grammar points to exactly ONE introducing lesson, in i+1 order
   (D9: families organize, frequency/i+1 order); persist `course_module`/`topic`/`lesson` rows; compute each
   lesson's `cumulative_known_set`. Enumerate N5/N4 **grammar points** (≥3 refs) into `grammar_point`.
2. **P5 pilot (mandatory gate):** pick ONE topic (recommend **N5 T01 — は/です**); upgrade
   `sudachidict-core`→`sudachidict-full`; **build the §7 validation suite FIRST**; write the SudachiPy (A+C)
   dissection pipeline + Layer-B pt-BR translation (generate, validate vs EN+dict) + token glosses + particle
   explanations; select Tatoeba sentences via FTS within the cumulative-known-set (i+1); author the topic's
   lessons (dense pt-BR + exercises, by-ID); **score vs `design/quality_rubric.md`**; fix; then scale.
**Foundation COMPLETE** (P-pre,L,R,P0–P3): leveled+linked corpus in `db/corpus.sqlite`, all design docs written.
**Reminder:** real Tatoeba PT is 1.8% → generate pt-BR (Layer B, EN-pivot); generous AI sentence backfill,
all flagged; store kana+romaji; pitch data only (audio deferred).
**P5 dissection notes (verified):** `sudachidict-full` installed + SudachiPy A+C tokenization works. CAVEAT —
Sudachi `reading_form()` returns the *dictionary* reading, so override contextual particle kana in the
dissection: は→わ, へ→え, を→お (topic/direction/object particles). Build the §7 validation suite first; the
single dissection function must emit the §6 shape uniformly.

## Gate
**P0 → P7 do NOT begin until the owner approves the Phase R output.** L and R gate the build.

## Validation thresholds (working defaults; may be revised in R3)
- Dissected sentences: **≥3 per vocab**, **≥5 per grammar point**; rich per-topic bank (hundreds where sources allow).
- AI-generated sentences: capped as a % per topic (cap set in R3), always `needs_review`.
- Zero unresolved reading/lemma mismatches against KANJIDIC2 / JMdict.

## Session log
- _(P-pre)_ Created dedicated git repo, folder tree, `CLAUDE.md`, `STATE.md`, `.gitignore`, `INDEX.md` stub.
- _(L)_ Clean-room analysis via isolated subagent (raw material never entered main context). Found a library
  of 11 courses / 73 modules / 621 lessons (beginner→intermediate→advanced spine + 8 supplements). Output:
  3 de-identified abstraction files, verified clean (no names, no verbatim/reworded text). Key gaps to beat:
  no pitch accent, no JLPT scaffolding, katakana/adjectives/time-vocab mis-sequenced, hard difficulty cliff.
- _(R3)_ Probed real datasets: kanji 100% covered (245), vocab ~99% after normalization, Tatoeba PT only 1.8%
  (→ generate pt-BR Layer B, EN-pivot 93.5%), audio 2.5% (→ TTS), ≥3/vocab & ≥5/grammar thresholds realistic.
- _(R2)_ Workflow: 4 cited research notes + adversarial verify (8 agents). Curricula/SLA/BR-market = solid;
  BR-PT = minor issues → 4 factual overstatements corrected at source (vowel "1:1", length 2.5–3x, /u/ "spread",
  ち/じ dialect) + SLA phonetic-component softening. Verification traces added to the notes.
- _(R1/R4/R5/R6)_ Wrote PLAN_REVIEW (audit + 14 decisions + improved-spec addendum), schema_v2 (6 hard examples
  pass), quality_rubric (6 dims + hard gates + pilot gate), course_outline draft (pre-N5/N5/N4), sources.md.
  **STOPPED at the approval gate per the kickoff instruction.**
