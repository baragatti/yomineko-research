## ▶ RESUME HERE
> **2026-06-14 (resumed; limit cleared).** Content-gap fill in progress. **Status:** meanings — kanji 250/250 ✓,
> N5 vocab 2249/2249 ✓, N4 vocab **1320/1812** (492 left). grammar explanations — **250/364** (N5 **151/151 ✓**,
> N4 99/213; 114 left). Use **per-chunk files** for grammar (robust) and run **ONE workflow at a time** (concurrent
> runs cause transient server rate-limits). Engines all built.
>
> **✅ Foundation + content COMPLETE & verified** (`reports/completeness.md`): meanings 100%, grammar 364/364,
> families cover all items, pitch 89.8%, dissection template fully met. **✅ P7 groundwork done (low-token pass
> 2026-06-14):** §1.7 graph queries all PASS (`reports/graph_query_tests.md`, acceptance #10); review queue
> assembled (`reports/review_queue.md`, 6,193 items, #8); coverage-comparison vs L+ confirms superset
> (`reports/coverage_comparison.md`, #13); topic objectives 35/35 + module overviews 3/3; example_vocab_ids +
> grammar_related contrast links fixed.
>
> **THE ONLY token-heavy work left = P5 (sentence bank) + P6 (lessons), topic-by-topic.** Recipe below.
> **Run ONE workflow at a time** (concurrency → server rate-limits). Result extraction: read the workflow
> `.output`, take its `.result` array (wrapped in `{summary,…,result}`), rewrite as bare array, then persist.
> Final P7 after the bank fills: full `validate.py` run + numeric coverage (sentences/item) + final stats.

**Plan (revised after 2026-06-14 gaps audit — see `reports/gaps_audit.md`):** content layers were
missing from the plan. Execute the ADDED steps in dependency order, THEN resume topic dissection:
1. **P5b — Layer-B pt-BR meanings (FOUNDATIONAL, do first):** translate `vocab_sense.gloss_en→gloss_pt`
   (4,061) + `kanji.meanings_en→meanings_pt` (250) via batch→Workflow→validate; populate
   `kanji_reading.example_vocab_ids`. Everything (lessons, glosses) depends on this.
2. **P6-grammar — Layer-C grammar explanations:** author `label_pt`+`explanation_pt`+`formation_pt`+
   `nuance_pt` per taught grammar point (Workflow, needs_review). ← owner flag.
3. **P4b — full families:** semantic_field / word_family / particle_set / contrast_pair so every item ∈ ≥1 family.
4. **P2b — pitch accent data:** source kanjium/OJAD-derived → `vocab_pitch` (data only; audio deferred).
5. **Then resume** mass dissection + lesson authoring topic-by-topic (recipe below), then **P7** QA.

### Topic dissection recipe (P5/P6 mass-production — proven on te-form, 19 sentences/0 errors)
1. `prepare_batch.py --topic <slug> --targets <term:count …> --out research/derived/batch_<slug>.json`
   (targets = the topic's grammar sub-points to ≥5 + its key vocab to ≥3).
2. Launch the **dissection Workflow** (inline script in session, or saved) with
   `args={batch_path, count}` → author+verify (15/15 faithful last run). **Note:** pass `count` AND keep the
   `N = A.count || <n>` fallback (args binding was flaky once).
3. Copy the workflow `.output`, extract its `.result` array → `..._result.json`,
   `persist_batch.py --batch … --result …`, then `validate.py`.
4. Author the topic's lessons (pattern: `add_pilot_lesson.py` → generalize), `export_corpus.py` +
   `export_course.py`, commit.
Then **P7**: full validation, `reports/stats.md`, coverage comparison vs L+ `concept_inventory.md` (superset),
§1.7 cross-cutting query tests, assemble needs_review queue.
**Pipeline scripts:** dissect / select_candidates / prepare_batch / persist_dissection / persist_batch /
validate / add_pilot_lesson / export_corpus / export_course. Kana caveat は→わ,へ→え,を→o; pt-BR generated
Layer-B (EN-pivot); generous AI backfill all flagged; store kana+romaji; pitch data only (audio deferred).
**Scale reminder:** this is the multi-session bulk (~all topics × dissection + lessons).
Recommend pilot = **`top:n5-te-form`** (mid-N5; rich Tatoeba supply; known-set = items introduced in topics
order≤15). Steps: (1) **build the §7 validation suite first** (`scripts/validate/`); (2) write the SudachiPy
A+C **dissection pipeline** (kana caveat: は→わ, へ→え, を→お) emitting the §6 shape uniformly; (3) **select**
Tatoeba sentences via `raw_tatoeba_fts` whose tokens are within the topic's cumulative-known-set (i+1),
preferring those with EN/audio; (4) **Layer-B pt-BR**: generate translation + pt_literal + per-token gloss +
particle explanation, validate readings/lemmas vs KANJIDIC2/JMdict; persist to `sentence`/`token`/`particle`;
(5) author the topic's **lessons** (dense pt-BR + structured exercises, sentence refs BY ID); (6) export
`corpus/sentences/` + `course/n5/top-...`; **score vs `design/quality_rubric.md`** (all dims ≥3, gates pass);
fix; commit. Cumulative-known-set helper: items with `introducing_topic_id` whose topic.ord ≤ pilot topic.ord.
**DONE:** P-pre,L(+L+),R(approved),P0,P1,P2,P3,P4(1st-pass placement). Corpus (kanji 250 / vocab 1,359 /
grammar 363 / families 58) + course outline (35 topics) all exported to `corpus/`+`course/` as canonical
LLM-readable JSON+MD; SQLite is a regenerable index.
**Reminder:** real Tatoeba PT is 1.8% → generate pt-BR (Layer B, EN-pivot 93.5%); generous AI backfill (all
flagged); store kana+romaji; pitch data only (audio deferred). `sudachidict-full` installed.
**P5 dissection notes (verified):** `sudachidict-full` installed + SudachiPy A+C tokenization works. CAVEAT —
Sudachi `reading_form()` returns the *dictionary* reading, so override contextual particle kana in the
dissection: は→わ, へ→え, を→お (topic/direction/object particles). Build the §7 validation suite first; the
single dissection function must emit the §6 shape uniformly.

## Gate
**P0 → P7 do NOT begin until the owner approves the Phase R output.** L and R gate the build.

## Validation thresholds (working defaults; may be revised in R3)
- Dissected sentences: **≥3 per vocab**, **≥5 per grammar point**; rich per-topic bank (hundreds where sources allow).
- AI-generated sentences: capped as a % per topic (cap set in R3), always `needs_review`.
- Zero unresolved reading/lemma mismatches against KANJIDIC2 / JMdict.

## Session log
- _(P-pre)_ Created dedicated git repo, folder tree, `CLAUDE.md`, `STATE.md`, `.gitignore`, `INDEX.md` stub.
- _(L)_ Clean-room analysis via isolated subagent (raw material never entered main context). Found a library
  of 11 courses / 73 modules / 621 lessons (beginner→intermediate→advanced spine + 8 supplements). Output:
  3 de-identified abstraction files, verified clean (no names, no verbatim/reworded text). Key gaps to beat:
  no pitch accent, no JLPT scaffolding, katakana/adjectives/time-vocab mis-sequenced, hard difficulty cliff.
- _(R3)_ Probed real datasets: kanji 100% covered (245), vocab ~99% after normalization, Tatoeba PT only 1.8%
  (→ generate pt-BR Layer B, EN-pivot 93.5%), audio 2.5% (→ TTS), ≥3/vocab & ≥5/grammar thresholds realistic.
- _(R2)_ Workflow: 4 cited research notes + adversarial verify (8 agents). Curricula/SLA/BR-market = solid;
  BR-PT = minor issues → 4 factual overstatements corrected at source (vowel "1:1", length 2.5–3x, /u/ "spread",
  ち/じ dialect) + SLA phonetic-component softening. Verification traces added to the notes.
- _(R1/R4/R5/R6)_ Wrote PLAN_REVIEW (audit + 14 decisions + improved-spec addendum), schema_v2 (6 hard examples
  pass), quality_rubric (6 dims + hard gates + pilot gate), course_outline draft (pre-N5/N5/N4), sources.md.
  **STOPPED at the approval gate per the kickoff instruction.**
