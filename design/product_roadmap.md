# Product roadmap — what the finished corpus must power, and the data it needs

The corpus is the data layer behind a Brazilian-Portuguese N5→N4 Japanese app. This maps each end-product
deliverable to the data artifacts it requires, marks status (✅ have / 🟡 partial / ⬜ gap), and plans the
remaining enrichment passes. Provenance + confidence are tracked on every generated artifact (Layer A facts,
Layer B derived-verified, Layer C pedagogy; `ai_generated` + `*_confidence` + `source`).

## A. Product deliverables → data needed

| Deliverable | Needs | Status |
|---|---|---|
| **N5 + N4 courses**, Module→Topic→Lesson | `course/` tree; topics placed | ✅ outline (35 topics) · ⬜ lessons (P6) |
| **Lessons**: medium text + rich examples + explanations + exercises | rich tagged-HTML lessons referencing corpus IDs | 🟡 P6: schema FROZEN (`design/lesson_schema.md`) + validator + pilot ✅; bulk authoring ⬜ (P6b) |
| **Linear course w/ unlock graph + SRS** | layered manifest (entry→course→topic→lesson), lesson `needs`/`unlocks`, FSRS decks (skill-typed), feature gates | ⬜ planned: `courseware_architecture.md` + `unlock_enums.json` + `kana.md` |
| **App feature unlocking** (each feature turns on at the lesson that needs it) | `feature` enum + per-lesson `feature_unlocks` | ⬜ enum defined (`unlock_enums.json`); wired in P6b |
| **Kana literacy (hiragana/katakana by family)** | kana registry + per-family lessons + SRS-bootstrap words | ⬜ planned (`kana.md`); registry `build_kana.py` is first P6b step |
| **Verb-conjugation training** (drag-drop pieces) + explanation | conjugation bank ✅ + **per-conjugation example sentences** + exercises | ✅ bank (508) · ⬜ examples+exercises (§C below) |

| **"Find the right kanji/particle" games, visual-novel** | distractor sets + answer keys derivable from corpus graph | 🟡 (graph ✅; distractor gen ⬜) |

## B. Open schema questions (answered from data + sources)

- **Vocab `forms` — per-form meaning?** No. `forms` are **orthographic variants** (573 vocab have >1 kanji
  form), i.e. spellings of the same word; **meaning lives in `senses`** (842/1359 vocab have >1 sense, each
  already glossed `{pt-BR,en}`). The rare case where a *specific kanji spelling* changes nuance (見る/観る/診る)
  is modeled in JMdict as per-sense kanji restrictions (`stagk`) — **planned**: surface `applies_to_forms` on a
  sense when JMdict restricts it. So: keep meaning on senses; do not add per-form meaning.
- **Vocab `pitch` — per-form meaning?** No. Pitch is **phonetic accent**, single per vocab (0 vocab have >1
  pitch reading in our set). Words whose different readings carry different meanings are separate JMdict
  entries. Pitch needs no meaning field.

## C. Verb/adjective conjugation EXERCISE bank (plan — build when P5 resumes)
Goal: ≥5 example sentences per conjugation form per verb, for drag-drop drills + JLPT.
1. **Mine first (SELECTION, high confidence):** every bank sentence already has tokens with `inflection`
   enum + `vocab_id`. Index `(vocab_id, inflection/form) → [sentence_ids]` straight from the bank → real
   Tatoeba examples per verb-form, provenance `tatoeba`, confidence high. (Spec §1.2: selection over generation.)
2. **Fill gaps (GENERATION):** for `(verb, form)` pairs with <5 mined examples, AI-generate i+1 sentences
   using that exact form (flagged `ai_generated:true`, `needs_review:true`, confidence recorded), then dissect
   through the normal engine (so they also enrich the bank).
3. **Exercise items:** from each example, build drag-drop items (scramble the conjugation pieces; answer key =
   the correct form from the deterministic conjugation bank; distractors = other forms of the same verb).
   Store in `corpus/exercises/conjugation/`. Same pattern for adjectives.

## D. Kanji per-reading enrichment (plan)
Have ✅: readings (on/kun/nanori, faithful to KANJIDIC2), meanings `{pt-BR,en}`, `example_words`,
`example_sentences`. Gap 🟡: Jisho-style **per-reading** grouping + pt notes.
- **Reading alignment (mechanical-ish):** align each `example_word`'s kana to the kanji's readings (match
  on/kun reading against the word's reading segment) → group compounds under the reading they use
  (On-compounds vs Kun-compounds). Heuristic; AI-verify ambiguous ones.
- **Per-reading pt note (AI, Layer C):** short pt-BR gloss of what each reading means/when it's used (kun ひ =
  "dia/sol, leitura nativa"; on ニチ = "leitura sino-japonesa, em compostos"). Flag `needs_review`.
- Surface on each `readings[]` entry: `meaning:{pt-BR}`, `compounds:[{word,kana,gloss}]`.

## E. Grammar pedagogy tokenization (plan)
Have ✅: `register[]`, `caution`, `forms[]`+meaning, humanized explanation/formation/nuance (locale-objects).
Gap 🟡: **structured/tokenized** formation + nuance (the user wants machine-usable structure, not only prose).
- `formation_steps[]` (Layer A/B, enum-tagged): ordered build steps, e.g.
  `[{base:"verb", op:"to-te-form"},{op:"append", token:"ください"}]` with an `op` enum
  (to-te-form/to-masu-stem/to-nai-stem/to-dictionary/append/replace-ending/nominalize…). Mechanical for regular
  patterns, AI for irregulars; verify against the conjugation engine.
- `nuance_tags[]` (enum): function tags like emphasis/softening/conjecture/obligation/permission/prohibition/
  hearsay/comparison/cause/condition — complements the prose `nuance`.
- `usage_contexts[]` (enum): spoken/written/business/casual-friends/formal-email…

## F. Sentence structured data (plan)
Have ✅: per-token `pos`/`inflection`/`role`/`gloss`, particle `function_type`, `grammar[]` links, prose
`structure_explanation`. Gap 🟡: a **machine pattern** for construction games/UX:
- `pattern[]` (mechanical from tokens): ordered chunks `[{chunk, role, particle?}]` e.g.
  `[{chunk:"私", role:"topic", particle:"は"},{chunk:"本", role:"object", particle:"を"},{chunk:"読む", role:"verb"}]`
  — derivable from tokens + particle links; drives sentence-construction drag-drop + distractors.
- `clause_structure` (enum): simple / topic-comment / relative-clause / conditional / quote … (AI-light).

## G. JLPT exam-simulation item bank (plan)
- Question archetypes (N5/N4): 漢字読み (kanji→reading), 表記 (word→kanji), 文脈規定 (fill-in vocab), 言い換え
  (paraphrase), 文法選択 (grammar choice), 文の組み立て (sentence ordering), 読解 (short reading).
- Generatable from the graph: stems from the sentence bank; correct answer from corpus; **distractors** from
  same-level siblings (same POS/reading-confusable kanji/related grammar). Store `corpus/exercises/jlpt/` with
  `type`, `level`, `stem_sentence_id`, `answer`, `distractors[]`, `explanation`, provenance+confidence.

## H. Courseware data architecture, unlocks & FSRS (NEW 2026-06-16 — full spec in `courseware_architecture.md`)
- **Layered manifest:** `course/manifest.json` (entry, required layer) → `<level>/course.json` →
  `topic-NN/topic.json` (lesson stubs w/ needs+unlocks) → `lesson-NN.json` (full content). App builds the
  tree + unlock DAG from the light tiers; lesson bodies lazy-load.
- **Per-lesson `needs` / `unlocks`** from a **closed global enum** (`unlock_enums.json`): `kana-family`, `vocab`,
  `kanji`, `grammar`, `conjugation-form`, `phrase`, `kanji-family`, `feature`, `srs-deck`. Generalizes
  `lesson_introduces`. Introduce-once + strict linearity (validator-enforced; kana-bootstrap words the sole
  exception).
- **FSRS:** decks separated by **skill type** (`deck:kana-hiragana/-katakana`, `deck:vocab-n5/-n4`,
  `deck:kanji-n5/-n4`, `deck:grammar-n5/-n4`, `deck:phrases`). Completing a lesson enrolls its items' cards
  (types per skill: recognition/production/listening/handwriting/cloze); first card creates the deck. Data-only
  (app runs scheduler). Build now (registries + per-lesson `srs.introduces_cards`) so authoring fills it as it goes.
- **DB additions (P6b):** widen `lesson_introduces.member_type` (or add `lesson_unlocks`) to the enum;
  `lesson_needs`; `kana`/`kana_family`, `feature`, `deck`, `card` registries; `export_course.py` emits the 4 tiers.

## Sentence sources & real:AI balance (researched 2026-06-15; deep-research → `research/second-source-deep-research.md`)
Owner preference: maximize REAL sourced sentences over AI. Findings + decisions:
- **Two REAL sources bundled, both clean-permissive:** **Tatoeba** (CC BY 2.0 FR, biggest, best beginner i+1
  fit) + **JEC Basic** (CC BY 3.0, 4,729 human sentences w/ manual en cross-check — second source added
  2026-06-15). Both allow commercial use + redistribution; neither is share-alike.
- **Rejected after deep research:** **JESC** (subtitles, casual register) is CC BY-SA 4.0 **and** built from
  fan-subtitle crawl → copyleft + upstream-copyright risk; **JParaCrawl** is non-commercial; **OpenSubtitles**
  grants no text rights; **KFTT/NICT-Kyoto** are CC BY-SA + encyclopedic register; **Tanaka** = Tatoeba's
  ancestor (redundant). **LICENSING POLICY (locked, ATTRIBUTION.md):** bundle only CC-BY/CC0 real text; never
  bundle CC BY-SA / copyright-murky prose, and **never use it as an AI generation seed** (a close paraphrase is
  still a derivative) → AI sentences are **clean-room** from our own known-set only.
- **Most "missing" coverage was NOT a real-sentence shortage** — it was (a) a **linking gap** (relink_vocab
  fixed +5604 edges: 青 had 508 raw hits, 2 linked) and (b) **over-filtering** (maxlen 22 / max-new 2). A
  relaxed pass (maxlen 40, max-new 4) over Tatoeba + JEC recovers more REAL sentences for the residual.
- **Order of preference (enforced):** 1) link what we have (relink); 2) mine REAL (Tatoeba then JEC,
  tighten→relax); 3) only then GENERATE clean-room, for the genuine rare tail real sources lack within the
  known-set. AI is flagged `ai_generated`+`needs_review`. **Content filter:** real sources are scanned for
  inappropriate content before persist (`extract_workflow_result.py` keyword scan; 2 JEC sentences dropped).
- **Current balance:** 55% real (2745) / 44% AI (2214) of 4959 — back over half human-written. A content
  blocklist (`research/derived/content_blocklist.json`, gated in `persist()`) permanently drops sentences
  unfit for a learner product; the grammaticality gate drops ungrammatical AI (verdict.faithful=False).

## Provenance & confidence (all generated artifacts)
Every mined item: `source:"tatoeba:<id>"`, confidence high. Every generated item: `ai_generated:true`,
`needs_review:true`, `*_confidence` recorded, `created_by:"ai"`. Distractors/answer-keys derived from Layer-A
facts are marked `derived`. Nothing ships without the teacher-review queue (acceptance #8).

## Sequencing (when work resumes)
P5 deepening (coverage→§10 + generation tail) → conjugation example mining+gaps (§C) → P6 lessons (rich
format) → kanji per-reading (§D) + grammar tokenization (§E) + sentence pattern (§F) → exercise/JLPT/game
item banks (§C/§E/§G) → P7 QA + teacher-review queue.

## Backlog added 2026-06-25
- ⬜ **N2/N1 bank pt-BR glosses.** The N2/N1 kanji+vocab banks (`design/n2_n1_bank.md`) ship with Layer-A
  **English** meanings only (pt-BR deferred per "minimum for FSRS"). Future AI pass: add pt-BR `meanings`/
  `gloss` for N2/N1 (mirror `load_n3_ptbr.py`), `needs_review`. Until then the prototype falls back pt-BR→en.
- ⬜ **English parallel for corpus Layer-B/C** (owner directive 2026-06-25; spec in `i18n.md`). Generate an
  `en` translation for the derived pt-BR fields (token role/gloss, particle/sentence explanations, grammar
  label/explanation/formation/nuance) and store under `localized_text` locale `en`. **Corpus layer only**
  (kanji/vocab/grammar/sentences) — course/topic/lesson text stays pt-BR-only. Layer-A English (kanji/vocab/
  sentence sources) is **already** preserved in the `en` key.
- ⬜ **N2/N1 depth (only if later desired):** sentence bank, grammar points, lessons. Out of scope for the
  current bank-only build.
